# Identify at least 2 differences between lists and tuples. Identify at least 2
# ways that lists and tuples are similar.

"""
 A list is mutable while a tuple is immutable. Because of this, a tuple is an
 acceptable (albeit questionable) type for a key in a dictionary, while a list
 would not be able to be used. 

 Both lists and tuples are sequences, which means their elements can be
 accessed by indexes. Tuples and lists are also heterogeneous, meaning they can
 contain different types of elements, and they do not all have to be the same
 within an instance of a list or tuple.
