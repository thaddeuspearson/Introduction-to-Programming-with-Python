# On reflection, we've decided that we don't want to rely on using a global
# variable in the code we wrote in the previous example. To fix this, we're
# going to nest the code from the previous example into an outer function.
# There's a bug in this code. Identify the bug, and fix it:


def all_actions():
    counter = 0
    
    def increment_counter():
        nonlocal counter    # needed to use nonlocal instead of global here
        counter += 1

    print(counter)                # 0

    increment_counter()

    print(counter)                # 1

    increment_counter()
    print(counter)                # 2

    counter = 100
    increment_counter()
    print(counter)                # 101

all_actions()
